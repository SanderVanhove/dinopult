This is the story of a small dinosaur
Who because of his height felt nailed to the floor
"Look how heigh up the others have grazed."
The little saur sayed, impressed and amazed
"But I'm just too small and I'll never be that tall,
Even when I jump I don't get anywhere before I fall"

His mother let out a sigh and looked at the boy
"Oh my little child, don't let that kill your joy,
You have a wonderfull life ahead and will grow in time,
besides we eat meat, leafs are not our prime."
The boy wondered about the problem and thought of a plan
He wanted to try those leaves as fast as he can.

Then a moment of insight came to his mind
He would build a catapult with the things he could find.
In no time the contraption he thought of was made
And the worry about  his height  began to fade
He jumped on his catapult as he shouted out a call
"Watch out leafs, I'm ready to eat you all"




He never felth so full and his belly, it bulged
There were to much leafs on the tree he indulged
His mom rolled her eyes and let out another sigh
"I told you we don't eat leafs and I hope you now know why"
"Oh momy I wish I never wanted to be so tall
now I feel sick and size doesn't matter to me at all"

The end
